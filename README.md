ProtonMail logged IP address of French activist after order by Swiss authorities

Lore from anonymous user: unknownuser534

What are you talking about? The recent environmentalist incident was a result of a Swiss court 
order, making Proton start logging the user’s IP address. For one thing, Proton didn’t give 
them IP logs from before the court order, only after they were legally compelled to do so. 
Second, because the user was using ProtonMail, the Swiss authorities couldn’t actually access 
his emails or their contents, because they’re encrypted, and Proton would not be able to 
unencrypt them. The only reason the guy was even caught was because of the fact that their 
IP wasn’t hidden. Had he been using something like ProtonVPN or Mullvad, the Swiss government
wouldn’t have been able to do anything.

That person was actually using both ProtonVPN and ProtonMail, not just ProtonMail.
