## ``Fourteen Eyes``
The "14 Eyes" is a term used to describe a group of countries that participate in an intelligence-sharing alliance known as the UKUSA Agreement. The countries that make up the 14 Eyes are:

    United States
    United Kingdom
    Canada
    Australia
    New Zealand
    Denmark
    France
    Netherlands
    Norway
    Belgium
    Germany
    Italy
    Spain
    Sweden

The purpose of this alliance is to share intelligence information among member countries for the purposes of national security and counterterrorism. However, concerns have been raised that this alliance could potentially lead to the sharing of personal data and private information of citizens among member countries, which could be used for other purposes beyond national security.

## ``Nine Eyes``
The "9 Eyes" is a term used to describe a subset of the intelligence-sharing alliance known as the UKUSA Agreement. The countries that make up the 9 Eyes are:

    United States
    United Kingdom
    Canada
    Australia
    New Zealand
    Denmark
    France
    Netherlands
    Norway

The 9 Eyes are a subset of the larger 14 Eyes alliance, and they are considered to be the core members of the alliance. These countries share intelligence information with each other for the purposes of national security and counterterrorism, and are believed to have close intelligence-sharing relationships.

## ``Five Eyes``
The "5 Eyes" is a term used to describe the core countries that participate in the intelligence-sharing alliance known as the UKUSA Agreement. The countries that make up the 5 Eyes are:

    United States
    United Kingdom
    Canada
    Australia
    New Zealand

These five countries share intelligence information with each other for the purposes of national security and counterterrorism. They are considered to have the closest intelligence-sharing relationship among the member countries of the UKUSA Agreement.

The term "5 Eyes" has also been used to describe the level of intelligence cooperation among these countries, which is said to go beyond the usual partnerships between nations. Their intelligence agencies are believed to work very closely together and share a large amount of information with each other.
